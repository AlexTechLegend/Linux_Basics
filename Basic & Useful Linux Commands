* `/ls -alh` To combine all of them the proper way.

* `/mkdir` Create a directory

* `/nano HelloWorld.txt` Will allow you to create a file and edit it right off the bat
alex@alex:~/Desktop/github_test$ nano HelloWorld.txt

For example you can run that command then type in "Hello World" then Ctrl+X to exit, then "Y" to save, Lastly make sure the file name is what you want it to be then hit "Enter"

Other ways to make file are things such as:
Vi
Vim
Touch
Emacs

* `/cat` Concatenate files and print on the standard output (AKA read a file without having to open it)

To read the file that was created in the previous command you can use cat as followed:

alex@alex:~/Desktop/github_test$ cat HellowWorld.txt
Hello World 

* `/mv` Move (rename) files
* `/cp` Copy files and directories

* `/ps` Report a snapshot of the current processes
* `/ps aux` This does the same as "ps" however it is much mmore in dept

Another way on showing different processes are:

* `/top` Display linux processes
* `/htop` A more detailed version of 'top'

* `/w` Show who is logged on and what they are doing
* `/who` Show who is logged on

* `/netstat` 

BONUS COMMAND!

* `/whatis` Display one-lined manual page descriptions
Sometimes you don't also remember what a command does so you can use that command to find out what it does.
