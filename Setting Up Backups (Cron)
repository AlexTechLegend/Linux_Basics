# Setting Up Backups (Cron)

``` console
This will be a quick walk through of how to set up backup for your linux machine.
Commands in this:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rysnc
rsync -av /path/to/source/dir /path/to/dest/dir 
crontab -e
crontab -l
```
# First you should also do a quick update
sudo apt update

# Then you will need to install this service
sudo apt install rsync 
and or
sudo apt install tar

# In order to get this started you will first need to define a source dir and then a dest. dir

# I made mind as follows:
/home/linux/stufftobackup

# Then my dest path
/home/linux/Cron_Backups/Logs

# Now you can give it an initial test and or log to start with.

# The initial layout will be labelled as (Minute|Hour|Day of month|Month of year|day of week)
0 0 * * * tar -czvf /home/linux/stufftobackup /home/linux/Cron_Backups/Logs
or
0 0 * * * rysnc -avz /home/linux/stufftobackup /home/linux/Cron_Backups/Logs

# Now you will need to set up the crontab (
crontab -e

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 17 * * * rsync -avz /home/alex/logtobackup /home/alex/Cron_Backups/Logs
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now under the last part you can add the following:
0 0 * * * tar -czvf /home/linux/stufftobackup /home/linux/Cron_Backups/Logs
or
0 0 * * * rysnc -avz /home/linux/stufftobackup /home/linux/Cron_Backups/Logs

# After you can type the following to verify that everything has been set
crontab -l

# Overall this will backup the stufftobackup directory and add it to the Logs such as:
/home/linux/Cron_Backups/Logs/stufftobackup

# Also that command will backup that directory everyday at midnight to the dest Logs directory

# Of course you can dive deeper but for starters, that is the basics to cron
