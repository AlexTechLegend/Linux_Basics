# Linux Redirect & Appending

``` console
This page will be covering the following:
* Redirecting an echo text into a file
* Appending more echo text to the previous existing file
* Redirecting error messages
```

# Redirection

* `>` In order to redirect anything to a specific file you can use this command.

Example: 

# echo "hello" > hello.txt
Please notw that if you do this over a file that is already created, It will over write the file.

# Appending

* `>>` In order to append something to an already existing file use this command.

Example:

# echo "I am adding new text" >> hello.txt
You can also use this to create a new file.

# echo "I am creating a file using the appending commands" >> Append_test.txt
This will create a new file with the quoted text. You can later add more text to this.

Now if you are wanting to get a bit more advanced you can run a command like netstat and append it to a file.

Example:

# netstat >> Netstat_Append.txt
You can do this will many different things which will allow you to log and track at the same time. This can later be used to automate different tasks.

# Redirecting Error Messages

* `2>` In order to redirect an error that you are coming across you can use this command.

Something that you can also do with the Redirection is you can capture different errors that you or your system are coming across.

Example:

# ipconfig /allh 2> ikpconfig_test.txt
Of course that is not the correct way to use that command however this will allow you to take the error that you are getting and putting it into a file. This could also be something that could be used on the automated side by logging errors.
